## About Me
I'm a researcher and applied scientist at Huawei Singapore Research Center. My current work mainly includes Large Vision-Language Model accelerating and development for autonomous vehicles and other smart devices. Before I joined the industry, I received my Ph.D. degree from the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University in 2021, advised by [Prof. Hanwang Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/hanwangzhang/). During my Ph.D., I worked on computer vision, especially vision language tasks and distribution bias problem. I'm also honored to be selected as one of the worldâ€™s [top 2% scientists](https://topresearcherslist.com/Home/Search?AuthFull=tang%2C+kaihua) based on these research. Prior to the Ph.D. study, I obtained my dual-master degrees in Computer Science from the joint programme of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by [Prof. Lizhuang Ma](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=154) and Waseda University, advised by [Prof. Sei-Ichiro Kamata](https://www.waseda.jp/fsci/gips/other-en/2015/09/08/2167/).  My B.E. degree is received in Computer Science from the IEEE Pilot Class at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2015.
